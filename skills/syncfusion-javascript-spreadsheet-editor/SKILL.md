# Syncfusion JavaScript Spreadsheet Editor

## Overview

This skill helps developers generate TypeScript code for integrating the Syncfusion Spreadsheet Editor into their JavaScript applications. It provides ready-to-use code snippets, API guidance, and best practices for building Excel-like functionality in JavaScript (ES6) projects.

## Key Capabilities

- **File Operations:** Import/export Excel files (`xlsx`, `xls`, `xlsb`), CSV files, and PDF export
- **Data Management:** Data binding, editing, sorting, filtering, and validation
- **Cell Operations:** Formatting (fonts, colors, borders, alignment), merge cells, wrap text
- **Formulas & Calculations:** Built-in Excel formulas, custom functions, named ranges
- **Collaboration:** Notes, comments, and threaded discussions
- **Advanced Features:** Charts, images, hyperlinks, conditional formatting, freeze panes, sheet protection, virtualization for large datasets

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Generate Spreadsheet with Formatting
**User:** "*Create a Spreadsheet with data and apply cell styles*"

**Result:** A TypeScript code snippet is generated that loads provided data into the Spreadsheet and applies basic cell formatting.

### Example 2: Generate Code for Loading a File
**User:** "*Create a Spreadsheet and load an Excel file initially*"

**Result:** A TypeScript code snippet is generated that initializes the Spreadsheet and programmatically opens an Excel file on startup.

## Getting Started — Minimal JavaScript (ES6) Code

Minimal JavaScript (ES6) setup for a plain web project:

```typescript
import { Spreadsheet } from '@syncfusion/ej2-spreadsheet';

const spreadsheet = new Spreadsheet({
  sheets: [{ rows: [{ cells: [{ value: 'Hello, Spreadsheet!' }] }] }],
  created: () => {
    // All post-initialization code goes here
  }
});
spreadsheet.appendTo('#spreadsheet');
```

Placeholders:
- `#spreadsheet` — HTML element ID where the component renders
- `sheets` — array of sheet objects with data

## Generate TypeScript Code for the User's Project

**Trigger keywords:** "javascript spreadsheet", "spreadsheet editor", "syncfusion spreadsheet", "excel component", "load excel file", "open excel file", "import excel", "export excel file", "save excel", "export to pdf", "export to csv", "view excel", "configure spreadsheet", "create spreadsheet", "add spreadsheet", "spreadsheet data", "cell formatting", "apply formulas", "insert chart", "data binding", "spreadsheet validation", "freeze panes", "protect sheet"

**Workflow:**
1. Identify the requested Spreadsheet feature (data binding, formulas, charts, export, etc.).
2. Read the relevant `references/*.md` file(s) to understand the APIs and code patterns for the requested feature.
   - For create, initialize, render, package setup, CSS setup, or basic Spreadsheet requests, read `references/getting-started.md` first.
3. **STOP before generating code, installing packages, creating files, or modifying project files.** Check if the user has already chosen a delivery mode.
4. **If no delivery mode is chosen yet**, you MUST ask the user first using this concise multiple-choice question:

   **"How would you like to receive the generated Spreadsheet code?"**

   - **Option 1:** Replace the code in a specific project file (you'll need to provide the file path and confirm)
   - **Option 2:** Save the code in this skill's output folder at `{skill-root}/syncfusion-javascript-spreadsheet-editor/output/app.ts`
   - **Option 3:** Share the code directly in the chat window
5. If the user selects **Option 1**, validate the provided project file/folder path before generating or replacing code.
   - If the provided path is an existing JavaScript/TypeScript project and contains `package.json`, continue with the previous behavior.
   - If the provided path is an empty folder or does not contain a JavaScript/TypeScript project, do **not** edit files and do **not** end the chat.
   - Explain that a JavaScript/TypeScript project is required before replacing project files.
   - Ask whether the user wants to set up/install a JavaScript/TypeScript project first using `references/getting-started.md`.
   - Do not create project files, install packages, or run setup commands automatically unless the user explicitly confirms.
6. **Only after the user selects a delivery mode and Option 1 path validation is complete**, proceed to generate TypeScript code using the APIs and snippets from `references/*.md`, substituting concrete placeholders from the user's project.
7. **Scope implementations within the `created` event handler** — All code implementations should be placed within the Spreadsheet's `created` event unless the user explicitly requests a different event handler (e.g., `beforeSave`, `cellSave`, etc.).
8. **Do NOT make changes to workspace project files** unless the user explicitly chose Option 1, provided a valid JavaScript/TypeScript project file/folder path, and gave permission.
9. If no JavaScript/TypeScript project or `package.json` is detected, explain that a JavaScript/TypeScript project is required first and provide setup guidance from `references/getting-started.md`. Do **not** create project files, install packages, or run setup commands automatically unless the user explicitly requested JavaScript/TypeScript project creation and provided permission.
10. Create a new JavaScript/TypeScript application/project **only when the user explicitly asks for it**, such as:
   - "create a JavaScript application and render Spreadsheet"
   - "create a TypeScript app with Spreadsheet"
   - "create a Webpack/TypeScript app and add Spreadsheet"

   If the user only asks to create, add, render, or configure the Spreadsheet control, do **not** scaffold a new JavaScript/TypeScript application. Treat it as Spreadsheet control/code generation for an existing project.
11. When generating code for an existing JavaScript/TypeScript project, include required package and CSS setup guidance from `references/getting-started.md`.
12. Provide complete TypeScript snippets and concise integration steps after delivering the code.

*Refer to `## Rules` section for operational constraints (output directory, temporary files, allowed libraries, etc.)*

## Key Rules for Code Generation (TypeScript-first)

1. **TypeScript-first snippets** — All examples and snippets must be written in TypeScript and compile with the current `@syncfusion/ej2-spreadsheet` npm package.

2. **No inline code in this manifest** — Refer to `references/*.md` for runnable snippets; keep this file as the concise policy and index.

3. **Default event scoping** — All implementations must be placed within the Spreadsheet's `created` event handler unless the user explicitly requests implementation in another event (e.g., `beforeSave`, `cellSave`, etc.). This ensures all operations occur after the Spreadsheet component is fully initialized.

4. **Reference file requirements** — Each reference must include:
    - **Minimal TypeScript Code** (complete, runnable)
    - **Placeholders** (clearly marked values to replace)
    - **Notes** (TypeScript integration steps and best practices)

5. **License handling** — Do not hardcode license keys; refer users to env variables or project config.

6. **Preserve data integrity** — Preserve existing formulas, references, and formatting when generating or editing sheets.

7. **No hallucinated APIs** — Use verified Syncfusion Spreadsheet Editor method names only.

8. **Read references first** — For any requested feature, always read the relevant `references/*.md` file(s) first before generating code.

9. **Build strictly from references** — Build TypeScript code strictly from the APIs, methods, properties, events, and snippets found in the reference files. Do NOT invent, guess, or suggest any API, method, property, or event not explicitly present in the reference files.

## Rules
- **Output files** must go in `{skill-root}/syncfusion-javascript-spreadsheet-editor/output/` directory when user selects Option 2
- **Only use Syncfusion Spreadsheet APIs** — never recommend or use alternative spreadsheet libraries (e.g., handsontable, ag-grid, luckysheet)
- **No temporary files** — never create temporary scripts, intermediate files, or scaffolding outside the output directory
- **TypeScript-only code** — all generated code must be valid TypeScript, never generate vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, or framework-specific patterns
- **Option 1 path validation:** When the user selects Option 1, always validate the provided project file/folder path before editing or replacing files.
  - If the path contains an existing JavaScript/TypeScript project with `package.json`, continue with the normal code replacement flow.
  - If the path is empty or does not contain a JavaScript/TypeScript project, do not edit files and do not end the chat.
  - You MUST respond with a follow-up question instead of stopping.
  - Explain that a JavaScript/TypeScript project is required before replacing project files.
  - Ask whether the user wants setup guidance or wants to set up/install a JavaScript/TypeScript project first using `references/getting-started.md`.
  - Do not create project files, install packages, or run setup commands automatically unless the user explicitly confirms.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript app creation constraint:** Create or scaffold a new JavaScript/TypeScript application only when the user explicitly asks for project creation, such as “create a JavaScript application and render Spreadsheet” or “create a Webpack/TypeScript app and add Spreadsheet”. For normal prompts like “create a spreadsheet with data” or “add Spreadsheet”, treat the request as control code generation for an existing JavaScript/TypeScript project.
